# eidos.ml #

eidos.ml is a library for machine learning writen in C#.

The main goal of the library is productive, expressive and performant development of machine learning pipelines.  

It is inspired by scikit-learn but tries to use advantages of C# syntax.

Name *eidos* comes from the Plato's theory of Forms, where it means non-physical (but substantial) forms (or ideas) representing the most accurate reality. Since machine learning models should simulate the reality as accurately as possible an *eidos* would be an ideal model.
